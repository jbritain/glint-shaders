**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE SUBMITTING AN ISSUE**
 - If this isn't a bug, but a general problem you are having, consider asking in my channel `#jbritains-shaderpacks` in the [shaderLABS Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RpzWN9S) instead.
 - Mods which add additional blocks, biomes, or dimensions (i.e Create) are not supported.
 - The shader not loading without an error message does not constitute a bug. Ensure your folder structure is correct.
 - MacOS is unsupported because I don't have a Mac. Things may break.
 - Old versions of Minecraft are not supported. I haven't tested anything other than 1.20+ but if you're on some really old version then don't expect it to work.
 - You can confirm that you have read the above by deleting this paragraph.
